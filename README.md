# AI-ML

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my journey through AI & Machine Learning, structured into four progressive levels of tasks. Each level includes practical implementations of ML concepts, ranging from basic data processing to deep learning with neural networks.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
level0.ipynb: Introduction to basic data operations, NumPy, and Pandas.
level1.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
level2.ipynb: Implementation of basic ML models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
level3.ipynb: Deep learning implementation using TensorFlow & Keras, including neural network training for image classification.
